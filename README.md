# pointCloudEditor

Now the point cloud data may be created by 3D scanners more and more conveniently. As the result of a 3D scanning process point clouds are used for many purposes, including to create 3D CAD models for manufactured parts, metrology/quality inspection, and a multitude of visualization, animation, rendering and mass customization applications. However, Maya doesn't support point cloud data currently.We have to use other tool to convert the point cloud data into mesh.It's too inconvenience.  

Full Description: 

Implement a plugin for Maya to edit, display, save/load the point cloud data.
 Basic functions:
 1. Save/load the point cloud data.
 2. Display the point cloud data in viewport, just like other geometry wireframe.
 3. Provide some simple filters for the point cloud data, such as passThrough filter.

 Advanced functions:
 1. Convert the point cloud data into mesh.
 2. Edit the part of point cloud data using translate/rotate manipulator.
 3. Grab the point cloud data from hardware.
